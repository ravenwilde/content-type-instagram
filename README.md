content-type-instagram
======================

WordPress plugin/custom content type for Instagram imports.

Plan for now:
- custom 'Instagram' post type.
- custom single and archive templates to display this post type.
- widget to display recent posts of this type in a sidebar.
- very basic css to style all of these things

Future plan:
- interface with Instagram API
- allow a user to access their own Instagram account and pull the photos of their choice 
- create new 'Instagram' post for each imported photo
- allow users to specify which categories and tags they want to append to the new posts
